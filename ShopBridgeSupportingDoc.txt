 --------------------



The contents uploaded to GitHub are:

1. ThinkBridge_Project_SQL - this contains the queries which need to be run separately.
2. ShopBridgeDAL - Data access layer of the ShopBridgeSolution
3. ShopBridgeProject - MVC of ShopBridgeSolution
4. ShopBridgeProjectTests - Contains unit test cases for the application
5. ShopBridgeConsole1 - Craeted just to test the DAL code
6. ShopBridgeSolution.sln - The ShopBridgeSolution
7. Packages1,2,3 - Packages has been split into three folders due to space constarint in uploading to git hub



First, kindly run the below queries in sequence from the ThinkBridge_Project_SQL folder in local database:
	a. CreateInventoryDataTable
	b. AddInventory
	c. ListInventory
	d. UpdateInventory
	e. DeleteInventory

Second, kindly put the the files 2 to 6 and (combine Packages1,Packages2, Packages3 in a single folder named "Packages") in a folder named "ShopBridgeSolution"
Third, open the ShopBridgeSolution.sln to test the application. Run the application (Preferably Chrome).

Enjoy the ShopBridge experience where you can add , update , delete and list the inventories.
